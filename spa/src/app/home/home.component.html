        <h4 class="yp-homepage-capabily-title">Gives the ability to investigate deleted videos.</h4>
        <span class="yp-homepage-capabily-description">
          In YouTube, you will not find any information about the video removed from the playlist. Thanks to this extension, you can understand what video has been removed from the playlist by its title, description, creation date, detection date, position in the playlist and image.

      <li>
        <h4 class="yp-homepage-capabily-title">Shows max quality video thumbnails.</h4>
        <span class="yp-homepage-capabily-description">
          While YouTube video creators can use high-quality images, we often see only small images in search results or on a recommendation list. Even going to the video, we often cannot see the image itself added by the author. This extension allows you to look at these high quality images in the generated playlist history.

        <h4 class="yp-homepage-capabily-title">Reserves thumbnails of deleted videos.</h4>
        <span class="yp-homepage-capabily-description">
          When someone deletes a video, you cannot see the associated images. This extension allows you to save the image before deleting it.
