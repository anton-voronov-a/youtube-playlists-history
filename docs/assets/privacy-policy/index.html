    <p>
      Playlists history stores all the data only on your computer, Google Drive API and chrome.storage. Google Drive API and chrome.storage use your account, which you manage. The app can create, read, update and delete files and folders on Google Drive API. You can change the name of the app folders on the app settings page. By default, the root app folder is called "playlists-history."
    </p>
    <p>
      The app reads your and other people's playlists and video info available by your YouTube account and checks the existence of your channel. The app does not change any YouTube data. YouTube Data API is used to provide mentioned actions.
    </p>
    <p>
      Your email and profile are used to display your current user account in the app using People API. This information is only needed on the app settings page and is not used anywhere by the extension other than your local computer.
