            Playlists history stores all the data only on your computer, Google Drive Api and chrome.storage. Google Drive Api and chrome.storage use your account, which you manage. The app can add, delete and read files and folders on Google Drive Api. You can change the name of the folders on the settings page. By default, the app folder is called "playlists-history."
        </p>

            The app uses your and other people's playlists available by your YouTube account. The app does not change any data in YouTube. YouTube Data Api is used to get your and others' playlists.
        </p>

            Your email and profile are used to display your current user account using people APIs. This information is only needed on the settings page and is not used anywhere by the extension other than your local computer.
